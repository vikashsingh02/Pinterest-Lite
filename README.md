# Pinterest-Lite
It's a small-scale functionality similar to Pinterest, where you can explore a collection of images and even search for specific ones using an input search feature. While it may not match the accuracy of Pinterest's search functionality, it serves as a great learning experience, especially for those delving into JavaScript.
